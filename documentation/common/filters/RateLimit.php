/**
 * Throttle for the credential and mail-sending endpoints.
 *
 * Yii's own RateLimiter keys on the identity, which is no use on exactly the actions that
 * matter here — login, signup and password reset are reached before anyone is
 * authenticated, so an attacker is never the same "user" twice.
 *
 * Two counters run per request, and either one tripping refuses it:
 *
 * - **by address** ([[limit]] / [[window]]), which catches one client working through a
 *   list of accounts;
 * - **by identifier** ([[identityParams]], [[identityLimit]] / [[identityWindow]]), which
 *   catches the opposite shape — many addresses against one account, and the mail/SMS
 *   flooding of one inbox that an address-only counter cannot see at all.
 *
 * The identifier counter is deliberately more generous than the address one. Throttling
 * by e-mail means an attacker can lock a known account out of its own password reset by
 * hammering it, so the limit is set where it stops flooding without making that cheap.
 *
 * Counting lives in the cache, so it is best-effort by construction: a flush forgets the
 * window. Two deployment facts decide whether it binds at all:
 *
 * 1. **The cache must be shared across web nodes.** The default is a FileCache, which is
 *    per-server, so on more than one node an attacker simply gets one budget per node.
 * 2. **`request.trustedHosts` must be configured if anything proxies this app.** Yii
 *    returns REMOTE_ADDR from getUserIP() and ignores X-Forwarded-For until it is told
 *    which proxies to believe. Behind a load balancer or a CDN that means every request
 *    carries the proxy's address, all visitors share one counter, and the first ten
 *    arrivals lock out everyone else. [[isAddressUsable()]] refuses to enforce the
 *    address counter when it cannot tell clients apart, so a misconfiguration degrades
 *    to "no address throttling" rather than to an outage — but it is logged, and the
 *    identifier counter keeps working either way.
